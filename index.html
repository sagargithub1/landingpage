<h2>Mens Wear</h2>
<p class="desc">Fashion and style have been a major cultural preoccupation since man first admired himself in the skin of a woolly mammoth whilst gazing at his reflection in the primordial swamp.

    Since then quite a lot has been said on the subject.
    
    Below we have gathered up our favourite quotes- because being able to whip out a witty quip at short notice is almost as important as the art of dressing well, itself.
    
    Style isnt just about what you wear, its also about what you say. One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.

   A man should look as if he had bought his clothes with intelligence, put them on with care, and then forgotten all about them.
Mens fashions all start as sports clothes and progress to the great occasions of state. The tailcoat, which started out as a hunting coat, is just finishing such a journey. The tracksuit is just beginning one.”
He who goes against the fashion is himself its slave.
Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new.
Trendy is the last stage before tacky.
